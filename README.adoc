== Spring Roo wrapping repository

This Git repository contains various script files that enable easy
production of OSGi-compliant bundles using a technique known as
"wrapping". These are generally used by Spring Roo and its add-ons.

The goals of the JAR wrappers are:

* Turn a non-OSGi JAR into an OSGi-enabled JAR.
* Patch libraries by replacing or adding artifacts inside the JAR.

The output JAR is then usable in Roo or other OSGi containers

== Prerequisites

In order to complete these instructions, you must have rights to
deploy files to http://repo.spring.io/spring-roo/.

All wrapped JARs are deployed under the following directory:

   /org/springframework/roo/wrapping

To perform wrapping you need:

* A proper installation of Java 6 or above
* Maven 3.0.1+ properly installed and working with your Java 5+
* Internet access so that Maven can download required dependencies
* Upload privileges to the above location
* GPG setup (see main Spring Roo readme.txt for instructions)
 
If you want to host an OSGi-compliant JAR that
does not need wrapping at http://repo.spring.io/spring-roo/,
be sure to create an .ASC file of the JAR and _pom.xml_ using 
`gpg --ab <filename>` and upload the ASC files as well.

== GIT Policies

The same Git policies apply to this repository as the normal Roo
repository.

== Naming conventions

By being `pkgArtifactId` and `pkgVersion` the `artifactId` and the `version` of
the "input" non-OSGi JAR, the wrappings must follow the naming conventions
below:

* The `groupId` must be _org.springframework.roo.wrapping_
* The `artifactId` must be `groupId`.`pkgArtifactId`
* The `version` must be `pkgVersion`.`wrapper.version`

NOTE: `wrapper.version` is a three-digit string that identifies the version of
each wrapper in order to know the latest release of that wrapper.

== Releasing

The wrapping repository is separated from the normal Roo repository at
Maven Central so that each project in the wrapping repository can be released 
as part of its own release cycle. The wrapping projects are NOT released
during the normal Roo release cycle and the Roo CI server does NOT
perform any wrapping module releases.

As such, it is expected that developers wishing to make wrapped JAR
available will manually produce/edit the relevant subdirectory of the
wrapping JAR and then connect to https://repo.spring.io/ to deploy the JAR
manually.

IMPORTANT: Before releasing, ensure you increment the final three-digit 
suffix for the version number displayed in the _pom.xml_. This ensures 
everyone is on the latest release you have made.
